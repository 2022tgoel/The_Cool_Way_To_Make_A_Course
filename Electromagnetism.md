height="300"} **Electromagnetism** is a branch of
[physics](physics "wikilink") involving the study of the
**electromagnetic force**, a type of [physical
interaction](physical_interaction "wikilink") that occurs between
[electrically charged](electric_charge "wikilink") particles. The
electromagnetic force is carried by [electromagnetic
fields](electromagnetic_field "wikilink") composed of [electric
fields](electric_field "wikilink") and [magnetic
fields](magnetic_field "wikilink"), and it is responsible for
[electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic_radiation "wikilink") such
as [light](light "wikilink"). It is one of the four [fundamental
interactions](fundamental_interaction "wikilink") (commonly called
forces) in [nature](nature "wikilink"), together with the [strong
interaction](strong_interaction "wikilink"), the [weak
interaction](weak_interaction "wikilink"), and
[gravitation](gravitation "wikilink").[^1] At high energy, the weak
force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single [electroweak
force](electroweak_interaction "wikilink").

Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic
force, sometimes called the [Lorentz force](Lorentz_force "wikilink"),
which includes both [electricity](electricity "wikilink") and
[magnetism](magnetism "wikilink") as different manifestations of the
same phenomenon. The electromagnetic force plays a major role in
determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily
life. The electromagnetic attraction between [atomic
nuclei](atomic_nuclei "wikilink") and their orbital
[electrons](electron "wikilink") holds [atoms](atom "wikilink")
together. Electromagnetic forces are responsible for the [chemical
bonds](chemical_bond "wikilink") between atoms which create
[molecules](molecule "wikilink"), and [intermolecular
forces](intermolecular_force "wikilink"). The electromagnetic force
governs all chemical processes, which arise from interactions between
the [electrons](Molecular_orbital "wikilink") of neighboring atoms.
Electromagnetism is very widely used in modern technology, and
electromagnetic theory is the basis of [electric power
engineering](electrical_engineering "wikilink") and
[electronics](electronics "wikilink") including digital technology.

There are numerous [mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic
field](mathematical_descriptions_of_the_electromagnetic_field "wikilink").
Most prominently, [Maxwell\'s equations](Maxwell's_equations "wikilink")
describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by
each other and by charges and currents.

The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the
establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the
\"medium\" of propagation
([permeability](permeability_(electromagnetism) "wikilink") and
[permittivity](permittivity "wikilink")), led to the development of
[special relativity](special_relativity "wikilink") by [Albert
Einstein](Albert_Einstein "wikilink") in 1905.

History of the theory
---------------------

![[Hans Christian
Ørsted](Hans_Christian_Ørsted "wikilink")](Ørsted.jpg "fig:Hans Christian Ørsted")

Originally, electricity and magnetism were considered to be two separate
forces. This view changed with the publication of [James Clerk
Maxwell](James_Clerk_Maxwell "wikilink")\'s 1873 *[A Treatise on
Electricity and
Magnetism](A_Treatise_on_Electricity_and_Magnetism "wikilink")* [^2]in
which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be
mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these
interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by
experiments:

1.  Electric charges ** or ** one another with a force [inversely
    proportional](Proportionality_(mathematics)#Inverse_proportionality "wikilink")
    to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract,
    like ones repel.
2.  Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points)
    attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and
    negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is
    yoked to a south pole.
3.  An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding
    circumferential magnetic field outside the wire. Its direction
    (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the
    current in the wire.
4.  A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or
    away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away
    from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.

![[André-Marie
Ampère](André-Marie_Ampère "wikilink")](Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg "fig:André-Marie Ampère"){width="140"}
In April 1820, [Hans Christian Ørsted](Hans_Christian_Ørsted "wikilink")
observed that an electrical current in a wire caused a nearby compass
needle to move. At the time of discovery, Ørsted did not suggest any
satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent
the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later
he began more intensive investigations.[^3] [^4] Soon thereafter he
published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a
magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [CGS](CGS "wikilink")
unit of [magnetic induction](Electromagnetic_induction "wikilink")
([oersted](oersted "wikilink")) is named in honor of his contributions
to the field of electromagnetism. [^5]

![[James Clerk
Maxwell](James_Clerk_Maxwell "wikilink")](James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg "fig:James Clerk Maxwell"){width="140"}
His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific
community in [electrodynamics](electrodynamics "wikilink"). They
influenced French physicist [André-Marie
Ampère](André-Marie_Ampère "wikilink")\'s developments of a single
mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between
current-carrying conductors. Ørsted\'s discovery also represented a
major step toward a unified concept of energy.

This unification, which was observed by [Michael
Faraday](Michael_Faraday "wikilink"), extended by [James Clerk
Maxwell](James_Clerk_Maxwell "wikilink"), and partially reformulated by
[Oliver Heaviside](Oliver_Heaviside "wikilink") and [Heinrich
Hertz](Heinrich_Hertz "wikilink"), is one of the key accomplishments of
19th-century [mathematical
physics](mathematical_physics "wikilink").[^6] It has had far-reaching
consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of
[light](light "wikilink"). Unlike what was proposed by the
electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other [electromagnetic
waves](electromagnetic_radiation "wikilink") are at present seen as
taking the form of [quantized](quantum "wikilink"), self-propagating
[oscillatory](oscillation "wikilink") electromagnetic field disturbances
called [photons](photon "wikilink"). Different
[frequencies](frequency "wikilink") of oscillation give rise to the
different forms of [electromagnetic
radiation](electromagnetic_radiation "wikilink"), from [radio
waves](radio_wave "wikilink") at the lowest frequencies, to visible
light at intermediate frequencies, to [gamma rays](gamma_ray "wikilink")
at the highest frequencies.

Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between
electricity and magnetism. In 1802, [Gian Domenico
Romagnosi](Gian_Domenico_Romagnosi "wikilink"), an Italian legal
scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual
setup of the experiment is not completely clear, so if current flowed
across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in
1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the
contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not
belong to this community.[^7]

An earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity
and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson.[^8] The account stated:

> A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of
> knives and forks in a large box \... and having placed the box in the
> corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder,
> lightning, &c. \... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some
> nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails,
> observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number
> was tried, and found to do the same, and that, to such a degree as to
> take up large nails, packing needles, and other iron things of
> considerable weight \...

[E. T. Whittaker](E._T._Whittaker "wikilink") suggested in 1910 that
this particular event was responsible for lightning to be \"credited
with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led
Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the
discharge of Leyden jars.\"[^9]

Fundamental forces
------------------

![Representation of the electric field vector of a wave of circularly
polarized electromagnetic
radiation.](Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light_Right.Handed.Animation.305x190.255Colors.gif "fig:Representation of the electric field vector of a wave of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation."){width="220"}
The electromagnetic force is one of the four known [fundamental
forces](fundamental_force "wikilink"). The other fundamental forces are:

-   the [strong nuclear force](strong_interaction "wikilink"), which
    binds [quarks](quark "wikilink") to form
    [nucleons](nucleon "wikilink"), and binds nucleons to form
    [nuclei](Atomic_nucleus "wikilink").
-   the [weak nuclear force](weak_interaction "wikilink"), which binds
    to all known particles in the [Standard
    Model](Standard_Model "wikilink"), and causes certain forms of
    [radioactive decay](radioactive_decay "wikilink"). (In [particle
    physics](particle_physics "wikilink") though, the [electroweak
    interaction](electroweak_interaction "wikilink") is the unified
    description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of
    nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction);
-   the [gravitational force](gravity "wikilink").

All other forces (e.g., [friction](friction "wikilink"), contact forces)
are derived from these four [fundamental
forces](fundamental_forces "wikilink") and they are known as
[non-fundamental forces](Force#Non-fundamental_forces "wikilink").[^10]

The electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena
one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception
of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions
between [atoms](atom "wikilink") can be explained by the electromagnetic
force acting between the electrically charged [atomic
nuclei](Atomic_nucleus "wikilink") and [electrons](electron "wikilink")
of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles
carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience
in \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" ordinary material objects, which result
from the [intermolecular forces](intermolecular_force "wikilink") that
act between the individual [molecules](molecule "wikilink") in our
bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also
involved in all forms of [chemical phenomena](chemistry "wikilink").

A necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular
forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the
electrons\' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting
atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons
becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due
to the [Pauli exclusion
principle](Pauli_exclusion_principle "wikilink"). The behaviour of
matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the
balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the
exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.[^11]

Classical electrodynamics
-------------------------

In 1600, [William Gilbert](William_Gilbert_(astronomer) "wikilink")
proposed, in his *[De Magnete](De_Magnete "wikilink")*, that electricity
and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of
objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning
strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between
lightning and electricity was not confirmed until [Benjamin
Franklin](Benjamin_Franklin "wikilink")\'s proposed experiments in 1752.
One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made
electric current and magnetism was [Gian
Romagnosi](Romagnosi "wikilink"), who in 1802 noticed that connecting a
wire across a [voltaic pile](voltaic_pile "wikilink") deflected a nearby
[compass](compass "wikilink") needle. However, the effect did not become
widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar
experiment.[^12] Ørsted\'s work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of
electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.

A theory of electromagnetism, known as [classical
electromagnetism](classical_electromagnetism "wikilink"), was developed
by various physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it
culminated in the publication of a
[treatise](A_Treatise_on_Electricity_and_Magnetism "wikilink") by [James
Clerk Maxwell](James_Clerk_Maxwell "wikilink"), which unified the
preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the
electromagnetic nature of light.[^13] In classical electromagnetism, the
behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations
known as [Maxwell\'s equations](Maxwell's_equations "wikilink"), and the
electromagnetic force is given by the [Lorentz force
law](Lorentz_force "wikilink").[^14]

One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is
difficult to reconcile with [classical
mechanics](classical_mechanics "wikilink"), but it is compatible with
special relativity. According to Maxwell\'s equations, the [speed of
light](speed_of_light "wikilink") in a vacuum is a universal constant
that is dependent only on the [electrical
permittivity](Permittivity "wikilink") and [magnetic
permeability](magnetic_permeability "wikilink") of [free
space](free_space "wikilink"). This violates [Galilean
invariance](Galilean_invariance "wikilink"), a long-standing cornerstone
of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories
(electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of
a [luminiferous aether](luminiferous_aether "wikilink") through which
the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to
detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of
[Hendrik Lorentz](Hendrik_Lorentz "wikilink") and [Henri
Poincaré](Henri_Poincaré "wikilink"), in 1905, [Albert
Einstein](Albert_Einstein "wikilink") solved the problem with the
introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics
with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical
electromagnetism. (For more information, see [History of special
relativity](History_of_special_relativity "wikilink").)

In addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of
reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero
electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to
a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are
two sides of the same coin. Hence the term \"electromagnetism\". (For
more information, see [Classical electromagnetism and special
relativity](Classical_electromagnetism_and_special_relativity "wikilink")
and [Covariant formulation of classical
electromagnetism](Covariant_formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism "wikilink").)

Extension to nonlinear phenomena
--------------------------------

![[Magnetic reconnection](Magnetic_reconnection "wikilink") in the solar
[plasma](Plasma_(physics) "wikilink") gives rise to [solar
flares](solar_flare "wikilink"), a complex magnetohydrodynamical
phenomenon.](Sun_in_X-Ray.png "fig:Magnetic reconnection in the solar plasma gives rise to solar flares, a complex magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon."){width="300"}
The Maxwell equations are *linear,* in that a change in the sources (the
charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields.
[Nonlinear dynamics](Nonlinear_system "wikilink") can occur when
electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical
laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of
[magnetohydrodynamics](magnetohydrodynamics "wikilink"), which combines
Maxwell theory with the [Navier--Stokes
equations](Navier–Stokes_equations "wikilink").

Quantities and units
--------------------

**Electromagnetic units** are part of a system of electrical units based
primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents, the
fundamental SI unit being the ampere. The units are:

-   [ampere](ampere "wikilink") (electric current)
-   [coulomb](coulomb "wikilink") (electric charge)
-   [farad](farad "wikilink") (capacitance)
-   [henry](henry_(unit) "wikilink") (inductance)
-   [ohm](ohm "wikilink") (resistance)
-   [siemens](siemens_(unit) "wikilink") (conductance)
-   [tesla](tesla_(unit) "wikilink") (magnetic flux density)
-   [volt](volt "wikilink") (electric potential)
-   [watt](watt "wikilink") (power)
-   [weber](weber_(unit) "wikilink") (magnetic flux)

In the electromagnetic
[CGS](Centimetre_gram_second_system_of_units "wikilink") system,
electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via [Ampère\'s
law](Ampère's_law "wikilink") and takes the
[permeability](Permeability_(electromagnetism) "wikilink") as a
dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum
is [unity](one "wikilink"). As a consequence, the square of the speed of
light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating
quantities in this system.

Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [Maxwell\'s
equations](Maxwell's_equations "wikilink")) need to be adjusted
depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no
[one-to-one correspondence](one-to-one_correspondence "wikilink")
between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for
mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible
choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit
\"sub-systems\", including [Gaussian](Gaussian_units "wikilink"),
\"ESU\", \"EMU\", and
[Heaviside--Lorentz](Heaviside–Lorentz "wikilink"). Among these choices,
Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase \"CGS
units\" is often used to refer specifically to [CGS-Gaussian
units](Gaussian_units "wikilink").[^15]
